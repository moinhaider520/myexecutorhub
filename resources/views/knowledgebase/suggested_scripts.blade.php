                        <p>Introducing Executor Hub to clients is simple when you have the right words. Below are five suggested scripts you can use in meetings, on the phone, or as part of client reviews. Each script takes a slightly different approach — from positioning Executor Hub as part of professional best practice, to highlighting the emotional benefits for families.</p>
                        <p>Tips for best results:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Use the script that feels most natural to your style.</li>
                            <li>Always include your unique referral link when following up by email.</li>
                            <li>Keep it conversational — these are guides, not word-for-word scripts.</li>
                            <li>End with a clear call-to-action: offering to send the client the free trial link right away.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <!-- TEMPLATE 1 -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Script#1: Trusted Adviser (Authority & Credibility)</h2>
                        <p>“I recommend this to all my clients”</p>
                        <p>Alongside your will and trusts, I recommend setting up Executor Hub.  </p>
                        <p>It’s a secure digital vault where you can keep everything in one place — wills, LPAs, trusts, and wishes — and your executors get step-by-step guidance when the time comes.</p>
                        <p>I recommend it to all my clients because it gives families real peace of mind. Would you like me to send you a free trial link so you can set yours up today?</p>

                        <!-- TEMPLATE 2 -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Script#2: Problem/Solution (Practical Pain Point)</h2>
                        <p>“Executors shouldn’t have to play detective”</p>
                        <p>When someone passes away, executors often spend months just trying to track down documents, passwords, and accounts.  </p>
                        <p>Executor Hub removes all that stress. It stores everything securely in one place and gives executors clear guidance, so your family doesn’t have to go searching.</p>
                        <p>It only takes 10–15 minutes to start the set up — would you like me to send you the free trial link?</p>

                        <!-- TEMPLATE 3 -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Script#3: Emotional Hook (Family & Legacy)</h2>
                        <p>“The most thoughtful gift you can leave behind”</p>
                        <p>One of the kindest things you can leave for your family is clarity.  </p>
                        <p>Executor Hub lets you store your documents, record your wishes, and even leave personal messages for loved ones. When the time comes, your executors won’t have to guess — they’ll have everything they need.</p>
                        <p>It’s quick to set up, and there’s a free trial. Shall I send you the link?</p>

                        <!-- TEMPLATE 4 -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Script#4: Social Proof (Bandwagon Effect)</h2>
                        <p>“Others are already doing this”</p>
                        <p>More and more families across the UK are now using Executor Hub because it’s fast becoming the new standard in estate planning.</p>
                        <p>It keeps wills, LPAs, and key documents in one secure place and gives executors step-by-step support. I’ve partnered with them because I think it’s a game-changer.</p>
                        <p>Would you like me to send you your free trial link so you can get started?</p>

                        <!-- TEMPLATE 5 -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Script#5: Urgency & Action (Loss Aversion)</h2>
                        <p>“Don’t put this off”</p>
                        <p>A lot of people mean to organise this, but life gets busy and it gets left until later.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, Executor Hub takes less than 15 minutes to start the set up — and it could save your family months of stress in the future.</p>
                        <p>Since it’s free to try for 14 days, I’d suggest setting it up now while it’s fresh in your mind. Shall I send you the link?</p>
