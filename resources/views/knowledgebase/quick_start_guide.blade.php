                        <p>Before recommending Executor Hub, watch the short explainer video in your Partner Dashboard.
                            This ensures you fully understand the service â€” and you can also share the same video directly
                            with clients to help them see the benefits.</p>

                        <p>Go to the Client Outreach Toolkit in the Knowledgebase and choose an email, WhatsApp message,
                            social post template or one of the scripts. These are designed to make it easy to explain the
                            service and get clients interested.</p>
