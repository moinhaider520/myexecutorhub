                        <p>Sometimes you only have a few seconds to capture a client’s attention — on the phone, in a voicemail, or at the start of a meeting. These short openers are designed to spark interest in Executor Hub quickly, before following up with a fuller explanation or sending the free trial link.</p>
                        <p>Use them naturally, then pause to let the client respond.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Opener#1: Trusted Adviser</h2>
                        <p>“I recommend this to all my clients”</p>
                        <p>I just wanted to let you know I recommend Executor Hub to all my clients — it’s a secure way to keep everything in one place and guide your executors when the time comes.</p>

                        <!-- TEMPLATE 2 -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Opener#2: Problem/Solution</h2>
                        <p>“Executors shouldn’t have to play detective”</p>
                        <p>Many executors end up spending months hunting for documents and passwords — Executor Hub solves that by keeping everything secure in one place.</p>

                        <!-- TEMPLATE 3 -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Opener#3: Emotional Hook</h2>
                        <p>“The most thoughtful gift you can leave behind”</p>
                        <p>One of the most thoughtful things you can leave your family is clarity, and Executor Hub makes that possible.</p>

                        <!-- TEMPLATE 4 -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Opener#4: Social Proof</h2>
                        <p>“Others are already doing this”</p>
                        <p>More and more families are now using Executor Hub as part of their planning — it’s quickly becoming the new standard.</p>


                        <!-- TEMPLATE 5 -->
                        <h2 class="mb-4">Opener#5: Urgency & Action (Loss Aversion)</h2>
                        <p>“Don’t put this off”</p>
                        <p>Executor Hub only takes about 10 minutes to start the set up, but it can save your family months of stress later — that’s why I suggest setting it up now.</p>
