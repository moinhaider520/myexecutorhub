                        <p>Many of your clients already have wills, trusts, or LPAs in place — sometimes completed months or
                            years ago. Executor Hub is the perfect way to re-engage these clients and add extra value,
                            because it’s a service that likely wasn’t available when their documents were done.</p>
                        <p>Use the templates below (email + SMS/WhatsApp) to introduce Executor Hub as a simple, modern
                            upgrade. Position it as part of your ongoing support, not a sales pitch.</p>
                        <p>👉 Tip: Always include your unique referral link so the subscription is tracked to you.</p>
                        <p>👉 Tip: Follow up politely within a few days — by phone, text, or email reminder.</p>

                        <p>• A simple upgrade to your planning</p>
                        <p>• New: Make your executors’ job much easier</p>

                        <p>Hi [First Name], </p>
                        <p>When we completed your will and estate planning with you, we made sure your documents were
                            legally sound and your wishes clear. </p>
                        <p>Since then, a new service has launched that I now recommend to all clients — **Executor Hub**.
                        </p>

                        <p>✔ Leave messages for loved ones </p>
                        <p>✔ Give your executors step-by-step guidance when the time comes </p>
                        <p>It’s designed to save families months of stress and uncertainty, and it only takes around 10
                            minutes to set your account up. </p>

                            for your family later. </p>

                        <p>Adviser Best Practice Notes</p>
                        <p>•	Send the email first, then follow up with a short SMS/WhatsApp within 3–5 days.</p>
                        <p>•	Frame it as a helpful update: “This wasn’t available when we first did your documents, but it’s now the new standard I recommend to all clients.”</p>
                        <p>•	Ask permission to follow up:</p>
                        <p>“Would it be okay if I check in next week to see if you’ve had a chance to set it up?”</p>
                        <p>•	Even if only a small % sign up, this adds up quickly because it’s recurring income and strengthens your relationship with existing clients.</p>
